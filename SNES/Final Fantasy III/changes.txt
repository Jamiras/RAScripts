[ach=5987]
Previously, you had to reach 50 points, where each kill was worth one point and using certain skills was worth 2-5 points per skill. Now, you only have to reach 23 points, where each kill is worth one point and each battle is worth one point. As a result, you still need to have at least three additional rats join the fight to trigger the achievement - more if you don't fight all five groups. But there's no longer any uncertainty around which skills generate how many points.
