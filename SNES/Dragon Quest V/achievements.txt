The following achievements are missable:

*Act I* (start a new game)
* [ach=40116]

*Act II* (save when prompted after watching Papas fight Gema)
* [ach=61365]
* [ach=61418]

*Act II* (save before picking a wife)
* [ach=61377]
* [ach=61379]
* [ach=61381]

*Act II* (save before doing the Cave of Trials)
* [ach=61373]
* [ach=61380]

*Act III* (save before going to the Great Temple)
* [ach=61401]
* [ach=61403]

There are several other achievements that aren't required to complete the game, but can still be earned with an end game save. I've ordered the achievements (up until the recruiting achievements) in the order that seems most natural for doing them.

I really struggled with this decision, but all wife-specific achievements can be earned shortly after getting married. There are no wife-specific achievements in Act III. I didn't want to force the player to choose one wife over the other just to earn some late-game achievements.
