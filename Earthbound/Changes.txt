Please note: Many of these achievements rely on text pointers so they can trigger at certain points in a dialog tree. As such, they are not guaranteed to function when using translation patches.

I have made the following changes:

The following achievements have been modified so they trigger if using the "Talk" or "Check" menu options (previously, they only triggered when using the L button):
* [ach=9334]
* [ach=13931]
* [ach=8941]
* [ach=9010]
* [ach=9330]

The following achievements no longer require Jeff be the third member of the party. Additionally, I and IV will now work if the item being converted is in Jeff's 11th inventory slot:
* [ach=8579]
* [ach=8785]
* [ach=10933]
* [ach=14389]
